00:00:05,00:00:10,Bob,"Morning, Alice! How's it going?"
00:00:10,00:00:15,Alice,"Not too bad. I've been working on that new feature we discussed."
00:00:15,00:00:20,Charlie,"Hey, guys! Sorry, I'm a bit late"
00:00:20,00:00:25,Alice,"No worries, Charlie. We just started."
00:00:25,00:00:30,David,"Morning, team! What's on the agenda today?"
00:00:30,00:00:35,Bob,"We were just catching up on Alice's progress with the new feature."
00:00:35,00:00:40,Charlie,"Alice, any challenges you've encountered so far?"
00:00:40,00:00:45,Alice,"Well, I had some trouble integrating the API, but I managed to resolve it with some help from the documentation"
00:00:45,00:00:50,David,"Great job, Alice! Is there anything we can do to support you further?"
00:00:50,00:00:55,Alice,"Thanks, David! I'll keep you posted if I run into any more issues."
00:00:55,00:01:00,Bob,"Speaking of issues, I came across a bug in the last release. Should we prioritize fixing it?"
00:01:00,00:01:05,Charlie,"Definitely, Bob. It's causing some users to experience crashes, so we should address it as soon as possible."
00:01:05,00:01:10,Alice,"Do we have any leads on what might be causing the bug?"
00:01:10,00:01:15,David,"I've started investigating, but it seems to be related to a specific module. I'll dig deeper and share my findings"
00:01:15,00:01:20,Bob,"Thanks, David. Let me know if you need any assistance with that."
00:01:20,00:01:25,Charlie,"In the meantime, I'll work on optimizing the database queries for better performance."
00:01:25,00:01:30,Alice,"That would be great, Charlie. Our load times have been a bit slow lately."
00:01:30,00:01:35,David,"Agreed. Improving the performance will significantly enhance the user experience."
00:01:35,00:01:40,Bob,"On another note, has anyone looked into adopting the latest framework version?"
00:01:40,00:01:45,Alice,"I haven't yet, but I heard it brings some exciting new features. We should definitely explore it."
00:01:45,00:01:50,Charlie,"I can take a look and evaluate the feasibility of the upgrade."
00:01:50,00:01:55,David,"Great! Let's gather some data and discuss it in the next meeting."
00:01:55,00:02:00,Bob,"Sounds like a plan. Is there anything else we need to address today?"
